  PWM Example
  ===========
  
  This example shows two ways to control the PWM output to an LED. The first uses a pot to set the PWM
  duty cycle, while the second cycles from 0% (Off) up to 100% duty cycle and then back to 0%. The first
  example is commented out (Line 23 to 27) while the second example is define in lines 29 to 46.
